## DATASET: Credit risk analysis

## Project Summary: 


## Possible Problems on the Dataset:
 
- Loan Default Prediction:
  Problem: Predicting whether a loan will default or not based on various features, including loan amount, interest rate, borrower's annual income, loan grade, purpose, and other relevant information.
  Application: Helping lenders assess the creditworthiness of borrowers, make informed lending decisions, and manage risk.
- Loan Payment Behavior Prediction:
  Problem: Predicting the payment behavior of borrowers (e.g., early payment, on-time payment, late payment) based on historical data.
  Application: Assisting lenders in proactively managing borrower accounts and collections.
- Loan Grade Classification:
  Problem: Classifying loans into different grades (A, B, C, D, E, F, G) based on the provided features.
  Application: Streamlining the loan grading process and automating risk assessment for lenders.
- Loan Purpose Analysis:
  Problem: Analyzing and categorizing loan purposes to identify common trends and patterns in borrower intentions.
  Application: Providing insights to financial institutions for product development and marketing strategies.
- Risk Factor Identification:
  Problem: Identifying the most significant factors contributing to loan default, such as loan amount, interest rate, or annual income.
  Application: Helping lenders mitigate risk by focusing on the most critical risk factors in their lending decisions.
- Borrower Income Classification:
  Problem: Classifying borrowers into income brackets based on their annual income.
  Application: Tailoring financial services and offers to different income groups and demographic segments.
- Loan Status Classification:
  Problem: Classifying loans into different categories of loan status (e.g., Current, Late, Fully Paid, Defaulted).
  Application: Monitoring and managing the loan portfolio to ensure timely payments and minimize default rates.
- Loan Installment Analysis:
  Problem: Exploring the relationship between loan installments and loan default, and potentially predicting the optimal installment amount.
  Application: Helping borrowers choose an installment plan that suits their financial capabilities.

These problems can provide valuable insights into the dataset, help lenders make informed decisions, and improve risk management practices in the lending industry. 

### We chose to tackle Loan Default Prediction, as it is a valuable tool for lenders and financial institutions, as it helps them make informed decisions, manage risk, comply with regulations, and ultimately optimize their lending practices to maximize profitability while minimizing losses due to defaults.
